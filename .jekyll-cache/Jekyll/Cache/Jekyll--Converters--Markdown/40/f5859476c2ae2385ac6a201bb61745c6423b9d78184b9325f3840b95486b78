I"<p>Today we present the web version of the manual. So far only the pdf version was available, which was hosted on Google Drive. Now we have a real documentation website on GitHub. We hope you will find it helpful and you will find easily what you are looking for.
Feel free to comment on anything and to give us feedback (on the manual or on the plugin) through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7r0Uhl2aauYCyBNpMgFrtRfP8oIJtjL_e5S1t7NHKmP15sA/viewform?usp=sf_link"><b>this form </b></a>.</p>

<p>This has been correctly updated in the welcome pop-up message of Terra Antiqua (v1.0.2).</p>

<p>The old pdf manual is still available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YauPn7iQ0677rOtbOIaBTwIBDpbLUAMyk4xwNpCGcGU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
