<p>Terra  Antiqua is designed with a particular workflow in mind (see <a href="intro.html/#workflow_summary">Workflow Summary</a>) oriented towards a full reconstruction from present-day geography to a global map of past geography. However, it is possible (and likely) that some users want to <b>perform simple tasks on their (paleo)DEMs</b> without going through the whole process. <b>Each tool may be used separately</b> (even the primary tools). They are independent algorithms perfectly functional on their own.
<p>The table below summarizes some cases for those users who do not wish / need to follow said workflow, practically serving as a list of “shortcuts” through this manual. It is meant to evolve and grow as it is used, so <a href="Developpers.html/#contributions">your feedback and comments are most welcome</a>. Although we are orienting this manual towards somewhat inexperienced QGIS users, some tasks must still be done using basic QGIS functionality or other QGIS plugins (Terra Antiqua can’t do everything!). These are duly referenced in the corresponding line.
