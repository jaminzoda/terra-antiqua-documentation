<p>This manual gives you all the information you need to use Terra Antiqua and explore its capabilities. After installing this plugin, a bundle of files can be downloaded that will allow you to start using the plugin right away. This set of files enables you to get familiar with Terra Antiqua and the use of its various tools. It is intended to provide an example of reconstruction and of the format of the input files.
.</p>
<a href:"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/TA_sample_data_bundle.zip" download>
    <h3> The sample data can be downloaded here</a> (temporarily not available, please use the alternative download link below). </h3>
  
Alternative download from Google Drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/141FTATSGFGStOdPeE8i4PNTuEf7ZV49X?usp=sharing">here</a><br>
The folder “TA_sample_data_bundle”  has to be downloaded as an entire folder (or a zip to unzip as a folder) so that QGIS can access that folder and read the files in it.

<div class="tip">
    <p>
    This sample data will allow you to do a full global reconstruction at 30 Ma. More files on different age steps (60, 50, 40, 30, 20 Ma) are available on <a href="https://map.paleoenvironment.eu/">map.paleoenvironment.eu</a>. In the following table, you see a description next to each file saying what it is and what it is used for.
