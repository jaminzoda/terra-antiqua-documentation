## Welcome to Terra Antiqua documentation page!

Terra Antiqua is a plugin for the QGIS software  that allows reconstruction of global, regional and local  paleogeographic maps. These paleogeographic maps then can be used, in the form of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) or symbolized raster images, as boundary conditions in climate models or for visualization of various geological information in its paleocoordinates. Terra Antiqua has an intutive graphical user interface that simplifies the usage of the plugin. It provides a complete set of tools to edit DEMs for paleoreconstructions, and offers robust algorithms geared to manipulate geographic features and raster grids generating maps for different time slices.

The workflow is intuitive, and the user is provided with guiding tips for each algorithm and tool. Terra Antiqua takes as an input rotated (e.g., in Gplates) present-day topography and bathymetry (e.g.: Müller et al., 2008) alongside vector masks that are used to define the continental blocks.

A user's manual is available where we detail each of Terra Antiqua’s tools, its use, and technical characteristics. There, step by step indications serve as guidance for the practical use of each tool.

### Terra Antiqua comprises two group of tools, namely primary tools and secondary tools.
