<h1>Known issues and Workarounds</h1>

<p>This table lists all known issues and errors the user may face while using Terra Antiqua. We are aware of these issues and are working on definitive solutions. The situations mentioned in this page are not integrated in the other sections of this manual because they do not concern everyone (probably only a minority of users) and only happen in particular cases.
<br>In order to identify many of these issues, you will need to pay attention to the Log tab of the Terra Antiqua tool you are using, or open the <b>Log Messages Panel</b>: <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html#log-messages-panel">instructions to open the panel</a></p>

        <td colspan="2"><section id="remove_overlap_issue">After using the <i>Compile Topo/Bathymetry</i> tool, small artefacts appear in areas where there is a gap within the topography raster.</section> The <a href="compile_tb.html#remove_overlap">remove overlapping bathymetry</a> option is not working porperly. These artefacts consist of parts of the bathymetry raster underlying those areas that are kept by the algorithm because they do not correspond to the perimeter of any continental block polygon and are thus not covered by the buffer when the option to <a href="compile_tb.html#remove_overlap">remove overlapping bathymetry</a> is selected. These gaps are not related to the rotation of the continental blocks and their overlapping because they are within a tectonic plate and not between two plates. The overlapping bathymetry that that lies over the boundary of two tectonic blocks is correctly recognised and erased by the algorithm.

                <br>
        This is not a bug of Terra Antiqua. We have noticed that GPlates erases the pixel values equal to 0 (and replaces these with No Data values) when the present-day topography raster is rotated. This creates gaps in the topography raster for areas that have an elevation equal to 0 and are located within a continental block (e.g.: Bahamas, northern and western shores of the Gulf of Mexico)</td>

        <td colspan="2"> <section id="smoothing_interp_issue">When using the <a href="set_pls.html#modification_mode"><i>interpolation mode</i> in the <i>Set Paleoshorelines</i> tool</a>, some shorelines may show artefacts such as large patches of 0 elevation pixels or distorted shorelines. Especially for isthms or peninsulas, this can sometimes turn them into islands.</section>

      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/issue_pls_interp.png" alt="image_of_shoreline_artefacts">
        
        <br/> This is due to the fact that the algorithm sets the shorelines fixed to the polygons edge, creating a "rim" of 0 elevation pixels. Depending of the resolution of the map and the source data (i.e.: the topography, bathymetry, rotation model, etc.) there are regions where the interpolation is likely to generate artefacts. </td>
