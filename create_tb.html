<title> Create Topography / Bathymetry </title>

<body>
  <p>  Terra Antiqua also offers the possibility to generate new geographic features when present day features can not be used (e.g. reconstructions of some mountains or basins that have disappeared).
        <br>This tool creates new topography or bathymetry in the DEM for the area defined by a polygon/mask prepared in a shapefile on QGIS.
        <p>The user can define several parameters that control the geometry and characteristics of the new features.
        <p>One can set the <b>maximum depth</b>, <b>minimum depth</b>, <b>shelf depth</b>, <b>shelf width</b>, and <b>slope width</b> to define the <u>marine features</u>. For <u>mountain ranges</u> , the parameters are the <b>maximum height</b>, the <b>minimum height</b>, the <b>ruggedness</b>, and the <b>mountain slope width</b>.
        <div class="technical-details">
            <p>Based on these parameters the new feature is created as follows:</p>
           </div>
           <div class="technical-details">

<ul><li><p>Create randomly positioned points within the polygon</p></li>
<li><p>Assign elevation values to these random points. The maximum depth (maximum elevation for mountains) is assigned to points that are furthest from the edge of the polygon and the minimum to pixels closest to the edge.</p></li>
<li><p>The  continental slope/shelf width defines the elevation/depth gradient that will change the geometry of the feature. For example on mountains a narrow slope on a broad mountain range will generate a plateau-like feature. For marine basins, a shelf-like geometry is created by having another parameter defining the shelf maximum depth. A shallow slope on the shelf itself is formed followed by a sharp drop from the shelf to the deeper basin that quickly reaches maximum depth towards the center of the basin. Adjusting the shelf and slope widths also affects the deeper geometry of the basin as shown in the examples below.</p></li>
<li><p>For the sea, the shelf zone is created using maximum shelf depth and shelf width parameters. The shelf’s depth values are interpolated between the maximum shelf depth provided by the user and the elevation of surrounding pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the entire area of the feature is interpolated to create a continuous elevation/depth values pattern.</p></li>
</ul>
    </div>
<p>Most features made with this tool (such as inland seas and mountain ranges) will be closed/symmetrical (e.g.: an inland sea will be completely encircled with a shoreline) because the algorithm treats each pixel at the edge of the polygon equally.
<p>For mountains, in the case that the maximum elevation entered by the user is below the preexisting topography, this higher preexisting topography will remain untouched so that mountainous features can be kept for a realistic result. However, if you want to completely create new topography, you should enter a maximum higher than the preexisting maximum. If you want to keep elevation lower, you can also first remove the preexisting topography with the use of the <a>Remove artefacts tool</a>. Alternatively you can first use <a>Mdify TB</a> before applying <b>Create TB(icon)</b>.

<p>For marine basins, the same applies keeping preexisting depths that are deeper than the maximum set depth. It you do not want to keep preexisting depths, they can be initially deleted with the <a>Remove artefacts tool  </a> or by setting values to H=0 using the Modify <a>topography/bathymetry</a>.
<p>In addition, a special feature has been implemented to enable connecting to preexisting oceans and seas. The created marine basin will most often connect to a preexisting ocean or sea. In this case the algorithm checks if the raster beneath the polygon of the marine area being created has bathymetry values (<b>H negative</b>). If it has, the initial value of the overlapping areas connecting the 2 basins will be used and the new marine areas will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

        In contrast to the Modify Topo- / Bathymetry tool, the original data in the new geographic feature’s extent will not be modified.
    <p>In the case of <b>topography</b> (mountain range creation), for areas with higher elevations than the created features, the preexisting topography will remain untouched. The rest of the region will  be erased entirely and not used to create the new feature.
    <p>Most features made with this tool (such as inland seas and mountain ranges) will be closed/symmetrical (e.g.: an inland sea will be completely encircled with a shoreline) because the algorithm treats each pixel at the edge of the polygon equally.
    <p>However, for the open seas that should be connected to the ocean, the closed shorelines will not be appropriate. In this case, the algorithm checks if the raster beneath the polygon of the sea being created has bathymetry values (H smaller than 0).
        <br>If it has, the initial value will be used, assuming that the polygon to create an open sea partially covers the oceanic basin, which the created sea should be connected to.
        <p>Therefore, to create an open sea/ocean, the polygon must partially overlap the preexisting bathymetry.</p>
        
        <div class="technical-details">
            <p>The algorithm, then, removes non-negative values beneath the polygon mask and creates random points inside the mask to calculate new bathymetry for.
            <br>If the polygon that is drawn to create a sea covers a part of the input raster with only bathymetry values (negative elevation) and no positive elevation values or NoData values, the algorithm doesn’t do anything since the input raster already has a sea/ocean in the selected area.
            <br>In this case, for explicitly creating a sea, the preexisting bathymetry should be removed first (for example with the use of the <b><i><a href="remove_arts.html">Remove artefacts</a></i></b> tool.</div>
