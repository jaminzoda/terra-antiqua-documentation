<p>Terra  Antiqua is designed with a particular workflow in mind (see <a href="intro.html/#workflow_summary">Workflow Summary</a>) oriented towards a full reconstruction from present-day geography to a global map of past geography. However, it is possible (and likely) that some users want to <b>perform simple tasks on their DEMs</b> without going through the whole process. <b>Each tool may be used separately</b> (even the primary tools). They are independent algorithms perfectly functional on their own.
<p>The table below summarizes some cases for those users who do not wish / need to follow said workflow, practically serving as a list of “shortcuts” through this manual. It is meant to evolve and grow as it is used, so <a href="Developpers.html/#contributions">your feedback and comments are most welcome</a>. Although we are orienting this manual towards somewhat inexperienced QGIS users, some tasks must still be done using basic QGIS functionality or other QGIS plugins (Terra Antiqua can’t do everything!). These are duly referenced in the corresponding line.

The most useful tools for a reconstruction in the future, however, are <a href="set_pls.html">Set Paleoshorelines</a>, <a href="modify_tb">Modify Topo- / Bathymetry</a>, <a href="create_tb.html">Create Topo- / Bathymetry</a>, <a href="remove_arts.html">Remove Artefacts</a>, <a href="smoothing.html">Smoothing</a>, <a href="fill_gaps.html">Fill Gaps</a>, and <a href="isostat_cp.html">Isostatic Compensation</a>. Please follow the step-by-step indications in those pages and keep in mind, in this case, the original geography (present-day) is older than the reconstructed one (future geography).
            <p>Depending on how distant the future map is, you may need to rotate the tectonic blocks in GPlates. If you have a rotation model for the future and want to use it, please refer to GPlates manual and section 2 of this manual (Preliminary Steps) to use it to prepare your input data.</p></td>
